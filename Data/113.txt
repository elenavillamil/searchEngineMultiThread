My extended bio can be found at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Alexevasion]

Some of my thoughts about the direction of the wikiversity project follow... My name is Alex Goldman.  I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Florida. You can find out more about me at www.clas.ufl.edu/users/agoldman. The idea of open source social science has recently captivated my attention.  presented a poster [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/agoldman/opensourcesocialscience.ppt] at the American Sociological Society this August on the concept and I hope to find as many other people as possible to help develop this project further. I am also in the process of writing a social theory paper based on the idea that the information technologies that have made the Wikimedia  projects possible now provide the impetus for a real transition away from our educational and journalism institutions (and the industries that support them) having a monopoly on the power to produce and distribute "knowledge".
